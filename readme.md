**Overview**


This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ETL pipeline for analyzing Twitter data using Apache Spark. It supports both real-time streaming and batch processing of tweets to uncover insights such as trending hashtags, user activity patterns, and sentiment indicators.


Built as part of an academic assignment, the application leverages Sparkâ€™s distributed computing power and is designed to scale using YARN and HDFS/S3 for big data storage and processing.


**Objectives**


Build a Spark-based application that ingests and processes live and historical Twitter data

Enable analysis via Spark SQL for querying structured tweet data

Generate one or more .jar files for modular and reusable data processing tasks

Demonstrate integration of streaming data with batch data workflows


**Technologies Used**


Apache Spark (Core, SQL, Streaming)

YARN for cluster resource management

HDFS / Amazon S3 for data storage

Python 3.9.0 / Scala 2.13.2

Git + GitHub for version control
